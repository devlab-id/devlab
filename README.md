# About the Project

Coolify is an open-source & self-hostable alternative to Heroku / Netlify / Vercel / etc. 

It helps you to manage your servers, applications, databases on your own hardware, all you need is SSH connection. You can manage VPS, Bare Metal, Raspberry PI's anything.

Imagine if you could have the ease of a cloud but with your own servers. That is **Coolify**.

No vendor lock-in, which means that all the configuration for your applications/databases/etc are saved to your server. So if you decide to stop using Coolify (oh nooo), you could still manage your running resources. You just lose the automations and all the magic. ü™ÑÔ∏è

# Cloud

If you do not want to self-host Coolify, there is a paid cloud version available: https://app.coolify.io

For more information & pricing, take a look at our landing page [here](https://coolify.io).

## Why should I use the Cloud version?
The recommended way to use Coolify is to have one server for Coolify and one (or more) for the resources you are deploying. A server is around 4-5$/month.

By subscribing to the cloud version, you get the Coolify server for the same price, but with:
- High-availability
- Free email notifications
- Better support
- Less maintenance for you

# Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash
```
You can find the installation script source [here](./scripts/install.sh).
