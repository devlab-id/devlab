Some of the files are here for backwards compatibility.

I will do things after 2 months:

- rm ./install.js and ./update.js
- rm ../install.sh
- rm ./Dockerfile-base
- rm ./obs
- rm ./check.js "No need to check env file. During installation, it is checked by the installer. If you change it between to upgrades: 🤷‍♂️"
- Rename Dockerfile-new to Dockerfile
